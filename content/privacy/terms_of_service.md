You must be 18 years or older and able to form a binding contract with us to use the products and services offered on the Website, including our application programming interface, software, tools, developer services, data, and documentation (collectively, the “Services”). If you use the Services on behalf of another person or entity, you must have the authority to accept the Terms on their behalf. You must provide accurate and complete information to register for an account. You may not make your access credentials or account available to others outside your organization, and you are responsible for all activities that occur using your credentials.

You may use our Services for free (a “Free Tier Account”) or subscribe to different pricing plans. Each account may be subject to a limitation with respect to resource usage based on your plan.

2. <u>SERVICES</u>

PunkGo.Ai provides you with tools and services to create game assets, such as items, environments, helmets, and buildings, with AI and craft worlds in minutes. You may use a general or fine-tuned existing model to general all sorts of production-ready art assets. You can also train your own AI model and generate thousands of variations and deviations from your training data, or from models on the platform that others have trained.

3. <u>CONTENT</u>

- a) Your Content. You may provide input to the Services (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input (“Output”). Input and Output are collectively “Content.” As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input, and subject to your compliance with these Terms, PunkGo.Ai hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output.

- b) Images created by a user while a paid subscription is active retain full ownership, copyright, and all other intellectual property rights to their images.  

    For images kept private on the platform, PunkGo.Ai retains the the right to use those images solely for the purpose of providing the services to the user.  
    
    For images made public, PunkGo.Ai and its successors retain worldwide perpetual rights to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text prompts and images you input into the services, or any assets produced by the service at your direction. PunkGo.Ai retains the rights to make the assets available to the public, and use them commercially for the purposes of providing, maintaining, promoting, and improving the services.  
    
    Additionally, other users also are granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access these publicly available assets through the service and to use those assets (including reproducing, distributing, modifying, displaying, and performing them) only as enabled by a feature of the service.

- c) For free tier users on the platform (whose images are public by default), PunkGo.Ai and its successors own the rights to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text prompts and images you input into the services, or any assets produced by the service at your direction. PunkGo.Ai has the rights to make the assets available to the public, use them commercially, including for the purposes of providing, maintaining, promoting, and improving the services. Free tier users are granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license by PunkGo.Ai to access the assets they create using the service for their own commercial use.  
  
  Additionally, other users are also granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access these publicly available assets through the service and to use those assets (including reproducing, distributing, modifying, displaying, and performing them) only as enabled by a feature of the service.

- d) For all plan tiers and generation types, PunkGo.Ai may use Content as necessary to provide and maintain the Services, comply with applicable law, and enforce our policies. You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. This license granted to PunkGo.Ai remains in effect even if this agreement is terminated by any party for any reason.

- e) Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for PunkGo.Ai or a third party.

- f) Use of Content to Improve Services. One of the main benefits of machine learning models is that they can be improved over time. To help PunkGo.Ai provide and maintain the Services, you understand and agree that we may use your Content or details around your platform usage to develop and improve the Services. If the privacy toggle is engaged on the Generations page, any ‘Input’ or ‘Output’ provided by a user is NOT subject to granting PunkGo.Ai and its successors the right to the Use of Content to Improve Services.

- g) Use of Content for Advertising Purposes. For any images or models not set to private, you agree to grant us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use your Content for advertising purposes, including, but not limited to, posting your Content on our Website.

- h) Model Promotion. If you train a public model that is popular on the Website, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to promote the model to permanent status on the Website, which means the promoted model will no longer count towards your Model Allowance and cannot be deleted by you. Users have the ability to keep models private if they choose if they prefer not to be subject to this Model Promotion clause.

- i) Any Output that is not set to private may be visible and usable by PunkGo.Ai or other users on the platform in derivative or transformative ways.

- j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, no AI-generated wallpaper created using Razer’s Axon Create may be used for commercial purposes.

4. <u>FEES AND PAYMENT</u>

- a) Fees and Billing. You will pay all fees charged to your account (“Fees”) according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. We have the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize PunkGo.Ai and its affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees. If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided in this Agreement. If any amount of your Fees is past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice of late payment.

- b) Price Change. We reserve the right to change our prices by posting a notice to your account and/or to our Website. Any price changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account immediately after the effective date of the changes.
