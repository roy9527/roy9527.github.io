<p>PunkGo.Ai provides you with tools and services to create game assets, such as items, environments, helmets, and buildings, with AI and craft worlds in minutes. You may use a general or fine-tuned existing model to general all sorts of production-ready art assets. You can also train your own AI model and generate thousands of variations and deviations from your training data, or from models on the platform that others have trained.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><u>CONTENT</u></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) Your Content. You may provide input to the Services (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input (“Output”). Input and Output are collectively “Content.” As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input, and subject to your compliance with these Terms, PunkGo.Ai hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output.</p>
